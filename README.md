# Intent Recognition for Dialogs

In this research project, we will create a Intent Recognition system for live-dialog settings. The goal of this project is to establish an agent that can identify different Speech Acts (c.f. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/speech-acts/) in spoken language using a Natural Language Understanding System.
